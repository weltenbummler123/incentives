Incentives have surprisingly inconsistent effects when it comes to encouraging people to behave prosocially. That is, the effects of incentives vary across incentive types, private versus public settings and across countries. Previous theoretical accounts have explained these empirical phenomena by postulating an additive effect of intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, reputational motivation, and costs. We build on these theories, but call into question whether reputational motivation can be derived a priori, by assuming an immutable cost (benefit) to being perceived as extrinsically (intrinsically) motivated. Instead, we argue that reputational concerns are governed by social norms, that is how acceptable certain actions are viewed by members of society. We empirically test our model on the real-world prosocial behavior of blood donation using a comparative dataset comprising representative samples from 28 European countries. We find that individuals from countries with more positive social norms regarding \textit{financial} incentives were more likely to have donated blood, although financial incentives themselves were negatively associated with prosociality. \textit{Non-financial} incentives on the other hand were overall unrelated to donation propensity, but we again find that more positive social norms regarding these incentives were associated with a higher likelihood of having donated (given that the individual resided in a country where non-financial incentives are in fact offered). The results indicate that social norms regarding incentives play an important role in determining the effect of incentives on prosocial behavior.

\maketitle

Humans are remarkable in the extent to which they engage in prosocial behavior -- and many communities want to encourage their members to help each other and contribute to public goods. According to classical economic theory, an obvious means to do this is by offering incentives \citep{mill_principles_1882}. For instance, tax breaks can be implemented to incentivize charity donations or blood donors can be remunerated to ensure a steady blood supply. However, incentives sometimes backfire, and can actually have detrimental effects on prosocial behavior \citep{deci_effects_1971, gneezy_pay_2000, gneezy_fine_2000}. Under which circumstances do incentives encourage prosocial behavior?

\paragraph{Inconsistent effects of incentives on prosocial behavior}

Empirical evidence examining the impact of incentives, that is as \textit{extrinsic rewards}\footnote{We follow \cite{chell_systematic_2018} in defining an incentive as an “extrinsically motivated reward, which can be monetary or nonmonetary and is used to motivate an action” (p.245). Extrinsic rewards are the positive \textit{external} outcomes that are associated with a given behavior, such as financial rewards, gifts or medals; this is opposed to \textit{intrinsic rewards} which are the positive \textit{internal} outcomes of a behavior, such as the simple pleasure in performing the behavior.}, on prosocial behavior has been inconsistent. On the one hand, it has been demonstrated that incentives sometimes encourage prosocial behavior \cite[e.g., tax breaks increase charitable giving; ][]{duquette_tax_2016}. A positive effect of incentives has also been found specifically for blood donation: For instance, \cite{goette_blood_2020} showed that lottery tickets increase donations, especially among less motivated donors. Similarly, \cite{lacetera_economic_2013} summarize evidence from observational and field studies, where 18 of the 19 offered incentive items (e.g., material rewards, lottery tickets, gift cards) increased blood donations, and this effect was stronger the higher the monetary value of the item. On the other hand, incentives can also have \textit{detrimental} effects on the amount of prosocial behavior exhibited. For instance, high school students going door-to-door to collect donations have been shown to gather \textit{less} donations when being paid proportional to the charitable donations they collected than if they were not paid \citep{gneezy_pay_2000}. Indeed, reviews both in economics \citep{gneezy_when_2011} and in the blood donation literature \citep{chell_systematic_2018} conclude that the effectiveness of incentives to encourage prosocial behavior is strongly \textit{context-dependent}. 

However, a myriad of factors is subsumed within this large bin of “context dependency”. One type of context effects are \textit{methodological} context effects. For example, it has been shown that substantial variation exists across studies using different data acquisition methods: Surveys tend to find that \textit{attitudes} oppose incentives (i.e., people tend to report in surveys that they are not attracted by incentives), whereas experiments and observational studies more often find positive effects of incentives on actual \textit{behavior} \cite[i.e., the amount of prosocial behavior tends to be positively affected by incentives; ][]{chell_systematic_2018}. Another set of context effects refers to the \textit{type and value} of the incentive provided. For example, blood donation behavior was increased more when incentives with higher value were provided \citep{lacetera_economic_2013}\footnote{Interestingly, the opposite effect for type of incentives was found for \textit{attitudes}: Survey respondents were shown to mostly have negative attitudes toward receiving financial rewards for blood donation, whereas attitudes toward receiving non-financial incentives such as small gifts and medical tests tended to be more positive \citep{lacetera_economic_2013}.}. Lastly, \textit{societal} context which varies across studies conducted in different countries and operating contexts has been shown to impact the effect of incentives on prosocial behavior \citep{chell_systematic_2018}. In the current paper we focus specifically on the effects of \textit{societal context}\footnote{With societal context we refer specifically to (a) the prevailing social norms toward incentives in a society, and (b) the country-level policies regarding incentives for donors.} as well as \textit{incentive type} on prosocial behavior, taking blood donation as a real-world example for prosocial behavior. 

\paragraph{Deterioration of intrinsic motivation by extrinsic rewards?}

Inspired by \citeauthor{titmuss_gift_1971}'  \citeyearpar{titmuss_gift_1971} argument that incentives lead to a deterioration of people's intrinsic motivation to donate blood, early research has highlighted the negative effect of incentives on prosocial behavior \citep{deci_effects_1971}. In particular, it has been suggested that this phenomenon of “motivational crowding out” originated from a decrease in intrinsic motivation due to extrinsic rewards (where the former refers to the motivation to act based on the \textit{valuation of internal outcomes}, such as motivation to behave prosocially due to a joy of giving, whereas extrinsic motivation refers to the motivation to act based on the valuation of external outcomes\footnote{
%Note that our broad definitions of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation as the motivation derived from valuations of internal and external outcomes, respectively, are adopted from the more general conceptualization of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation by psychologists Richard M. Ryan and Edward L. Deci, who explain that intrinsic motivation “refers to doing something because it is inherently interesting or enjoyable”, whereas extrinsic motivation “refers to doing something because it leads to a separable outcome” \cite[p.~55]{ryan_intrinsic_2000}. Thus, \textit{internal} outcomes refer to the inherent (dis)satisfaction or (dis)interest stemming from within the self, while \textit{external} outcomes are taken to be the (un)desirable outcomes associated with an action that originate outside of the individual. In this sense external outcomes motivate agents to perform a behavior not due to the (dis)satisfaction of the action, but due to its instrumental value \cite[][; for instance when a student does his homework not out of interest, but because of its instrumental value to avoid sanctions by his parents]{ryan_intrinsic_2000}. In the following we refer to internal and external \textit{outcomes} and motivational \textit{value} (instead of rewards or punishments) in order to include both gains and losses associated with a given behavior, which can in turn result in either encouraging or inhibiting behavior. Since we specifically investigate motivational pulls associated with \textit{prosocial behavior}, we follow \cite{andreoni_impure_1990} and suppose that the internal outcomes associated with prosocial behavior are composed of \textit{pure} and \textit{impure} forms of altruism \cite[where pure altruism refers to the valuation of the prosocial activity per se, and impure altruism refers to the valuation of the joy of giving, also called \textit{warm glow}; ][]{andreoni_impure_1990, harbaugh_what_1998}. 
While external outcomes can take on many forms (such as material gains, financial gains, or gains in status or prestige; or \textit{losses} of the former), we will in the following center our attention on two specific forms of external outcome: high-value financial and non-financial rewards (in the later case we focus particularly on time incentives, i.e., time off work).}) \citep{deci_effects_1971, frey_motivation_2001, gneezy_pay_2000, gneezy_fine_2000, mellstrom_crowding_2008}. Moreover, it was argued that extrinsic rewards reduce the option of the agent to indulge in altruistic feelings \citep{frey_cost_1997, frey_motivation_2001}\footnote{These claims are also supported by empirical evidence. For instance, \cite{frey_cost_1997} asked residents from two small Swiss towns whether they were willing to accept the construction of a nuclear waste repository on the grounds of their community, and manipulated whether financial incentives were offered to respondents or not. The results were striking: Whereas 50.8\% agreed to the construction in the no-pay condition, this rate dropped to 24.6\% when participants were offered financial rewards.}. However, incentives (financial or non-financial) also sometimes encourage prosocial behavior. What explains \textit{under which circumstances} motivational crowding out occurs?

\paragraph{Deterioration of reputational motivation by extrinsic rewards?}

One mechanism which may be crucial to understand under which circumstances incentives encourage prosocial behavior is \textit{reputational} motivation. Reputational motivation \cite[also termed image motivation;][]{ariely_doing_2009} can be viewed as a third motivational factor besides intrinsic and extrinsic motivation\footnote{Note that we follow \cite{benabou_incentives_2006} in remaining ignorant as to whether reputational motivation is instrumental and thus extrinsic (i.e., the agent benefits (suffers) from a better (worse) social standing) or purely affective and thus intrinsic (i.e., the agent acts based on the hedonistic value of pride or shame). Therefore, we treat reputational motivation as a separate source of motivation, being neither extrinsic nor intrinsic.}. We define reputational motivation as the motivation to act derived from the \textit{valuation of reputational outcomes} associated with a behavior, where reputational outcomes are the positive or negative evaluations of a behavior in light of what a society views as the \textit{right} behavior which members of society \textit{ought} to do. 

It has been shown that reputation can play a large role in determining the effect of incentives on prosocial behavior. For instance, \cite{ariely_doing_2009} showed in an experimental setting that when it was \textit{not visible} to others that participants received financial incentives for the amount of effort exerted for a prosocial activity, participants used \textit{more} effort to be prosocial when they were paid than when they were not paid. But when it was \textit{visible} to others that agents received financial incentives in accordance with the amount of effort put into being prosocial, participants actually used the same or \textit{less} effort to be prosocial when they were paid than when they were not paid. The authors take this as evidence that reputation plays a crucial role in guiding prosocial behavior: Behaving prosocially without extrinsic incentives \textit{signals} higher intrinsic motivation than behaving prosocially when receiving (financial) rewards. 

Similar findings became apparent in the literature on dictator games, where agents trade off financial reward for themselves (i.e., extrinsic motives) and sharing the endowment with another (prosocial motives). The classic paper by \cite{hoffman_social_1996} was one of the first to show that contributions in a dictator game were much lower in double-blind conditions where neither other participants nor experimenters could know about the participants’ choices, compared to when experimenters knew about participants’ choices. That is, the participants were more likely to be tempted by the extrinsic reward when their reputation was not at stake. Similarly, \cite{dana_exploiting_2007} examined to what extent behavior in the dictator game depends on how accountable participants were both to others and to themselves. They found that participants behaved less prosocially when they as individuals were less accountable for their actions (for instance because there were multiple dictators), but they also found that contributions depended on how accountable participants were to \textit{themselves}: Participants behaved less prosocially when they had the option to create "moral wiggle room" by deliberately letting chance decide whether they would choose prosocially or get a higher personal reward. This observation is also in line with theoretical insights in sociology, where the reputational effects with respect to \textit{others} (i.e., worry about how others in the social environment will judge the behavior) are contrasted with effects to the \textit{self}-image \cite[i.e., negative emotions experienced due to cognitive dissonance, when people ascribe to themselves prosocial personality traits but then decline a request for a donation; ][]{bekkers_literature_2011}. The findings from \cite{dana_exploiting_2007} and \cite{hoffman_social_1996} suggest that most people are actually not as altruistically motivated\footnote{A small subset of participants both in \cite{hoffman_social_1996} and in \cite{dana_exploiting_2007} do in fact still behave prosocially even if their choices are private and they are less accountable for their choices.}, as they are motivated by reputational concerns\footnote{This evident effect of reputational motives (both to self and others) does not surprise sociologists and social psychologists, who have been stressing the importance of social influence as prime motivators of behavior \citep{simpson_beyond_2015, barman_social_2017}. Interestingly, some have gone as far as postulating a "homo sociologicus", who is chiefly motivated by society’s norms, values and expectations \citep{dahrendorf_homo_1975}, and can be seen as the antithesis to the notion of "homo economicus" in classical economic theory. Contrary to what one may expect given the apparent focus on self-interest in contemporary economics, social influence has in fact a longer history in economics than what would be expected: The father of modern economics, Adam Smith, has already stated that humans are motivated not only by selfish motives but also by moral and social motives \cite[e.g., “Man naturally desires, not only to be loved, but to be lovely.” in \textit{The theory of moral sentiments}; ][]{smith_theory_1822}. As \cite{akerlof_identity_2010} mention, indeed “many economists have suggested related non-monetary reasons for people’s actions, such as morality, altruism, and concern for status” \cite[p.~6]{akerlof_identity_2010}, but it has not yet been credited with much importance in mainstream economics \citep{fehr_economics_2006, andreoni_charitable_2013}. The rise of new theories such as identity economics \citep{akerlof_identity_2010} and narrative economics \citep{shiller_narrative_2017} does nonetheless provide evidence for a trend shift that grants more significance to other-regarding motives in influencing human behavior.}. Thus, the effects of reputation may have played a role in producing the sometimes encouraging and at other times discouraging effects of incentives on prosocial behavior.

Although the idea that people care about how they are perceived by others has yet to be incorporated in many economic theories that aim to explain puzzling phenomena such as motivational crowding out, theories of prosocial behavior indeed taking into account reputational motivation exist. Notably, \cite{andreoni_social_2009} included a notion of reputational motivation in their model of dictator game behavior, where agents’ behavior is (among other factors) driven by a desire to be perceived as fair. Similarly, \cite{benabou_incentives_2006} modeled prosocial behavior as being influenced by a desire to be perceived as intrinsically and not extrinsically motivated. However, given that \cite{andreoni_social_2009} understood reputational motives to be driven specifically by \textit{fairness}, whereas \cite{benabou_incentives_2006} take reputational motivation to be stemming from the desire to be seen as \textit{altruistic} and \textit{not greedy}, the question arises of whether people desire to be (perceived as) altruistic, or fair, or as both or neither\footnote{One factor that explains the two different conceptualizations of \cite{andreoni_social_2009} and \cite{benabou_incentives_2006} is of course the kind of phenomena they were aiming to model: \cite{andreoni_social_2009} sought to explain dictator game play and related audience effects, whereas \cite{benabou_incentives_2006} aimed to explain prosocial behavior more broadly (including behaviors typically viewed as more “altruistic” such as donating to charity or giving blood). Evidently, there is a more symmetrical relationship between two university students playing the dictator game (which may in turn lead to more prevalent fairness and equality concerns, as modelled by \cite{andreoni_social_2009}), compared to the more asymmetrical relationship between a healthy blood donor and a sick patient (in which case altruistic motives may be stronger, as modelled by \cite{benabou_incentives_2006}). Interestingly, \cite{andreoni_social_2009} mentioned the role of such context effects when explaining that their model assumption of agents preferring a 50-50 split may not hold across situations. Specifically, they provided empirical evidence by \cite{cherry_hardnose_2002}, who demonstrated that agents often do not prefer the 50-50 split when dictators allocate \textit{earned} wealth. \cite{andreoni_social_2009} mention that in this case “players are asymmetric with respect to publicly observed indicia of merit” (p. 1611) and that in this case fairness must be redefined.}?

\paragraph{Social norms and reputational motivation}

In other fields, most notably in evolutionary biology, reputation is a major topic of research. In particular the study of indirect reciprocity \cite[i.e., receiving the benefit from an action in the future based on one's reputation, distilled in “I help you and somebody else helps me”;][]{nowak_evolution_2005} has brought reputational concerns to the forefront of explaining human cooperation and altruism \citep{nowak_evolution_1998}. Crucially, research on indirect reciprocity has highlighted the tight relationship between reputation and social norms: Norms shape the reputation of individuals within a society \citep{nowak_evolution_2005, alexander_biology_1987}. In other words, “[t]he revision of an individual’s reputation depends on the social norms that establish what characterizes a good or bad action [...]” \cite[p.~242]{santos_social_2018}.

Given the role of social norms in shaping reputational outcomes, the results from the above mentioned studies \cite[i.e., increased prosocial behavior when reputations are at stake; e.g.,][]{ariely_doing_2009, hoffman_social_1996} can be interpreted as being (partly) driven by \textit{prosocial norms} (for instance the \textit{norm of societal responsibility} suggested by \cite{cialdini_social_1998} or \textit{norms of fairness} proposed by \cite{fehr_theory_1999}). That is, prosocial norms dictate that a positive reputation results from being (perceived as) prosocial, and because people are motivated by reputational concerns, they behave more prosocially (despite smaller personal gains). 

However, recent evidence from Japan illustrated that altruism does not always lead to a good reputation \citep{kawamura_altruism_2020}. Instead, reputational costs or benefits from behaving altruistically depended on the prevalent social norms \citep{kawamura_altruism_2020}. This is in line with social norms being highly group- and culture-specific \citep{nowak_evolution_2005, alexander_biology_1987}. For example, cultural variation has been found in (need-based) communal norms versus (conditional) exchange norms \citep{miller_cultural_2017}. Similarly, it has been shown that there exists cross-country variation in prosocial norms related to environmentalism \citep{torgler_environmental_2009}. It also remains an open question to what extent differences in \textit{attitudes} toward different types of incentives \citep{lacetera_economic_2013} reflect differences in social norms regarding how acceptable these incentives are for a given prosocial activity.

Given the cultural specificity of social norms, we may expect cross-societal variation in specific prosocial behaviors due to variation in norms. Indeed, cross-cultural research in anthropology, economics and psychology found significant variation in many kinds of prosocial behaviors across societies: Dictator game experiments performed by \cite{henrich_search_2001} in non-Western small-scale societies revealed strikingly different results to what is typically observed in dictator games. Instead of exhibiting the 50-50 split commonly found in Western samples, most of the societies showed significantly lower contributions (for instance, in the Tsimané the modal split was 25\%). Research in sociology has also commonly examined cross-societal differences and has found societal variation in prosocial behavior. For example, cross-country differences in volunteering have been found and associated with differences in various factors, such as religiosity \citep{ruiter_national_2006}.
%, help within the neighborhood \citep{seifert_help_2019} and due to intergenerational differences \citep{brandt_intergenerational_2009}. 
Other evidence has indicated that culture influences the extent of cooperation among strangers \cite[see e.g., experimental evidence from 16 subject pools from six different world cultures presented in][]{gachter_culture_2010}.

In sum, there is encouraging evidence that prosocial behavior is driven by reputational concerns, and that reputational concerns are governed by the prevailing social norms that define what is viewed as the “right” behavior. Social norms, then again, vary across groups and cultures. Unlike previous \textit{assumptions} about what reputational outcomes are associated with a given behavior, we instead advocate for taking into account social norms for determining reputational motivation. By incorporating social norms we aim to examine whether we can account for the circumstances under which incentives increase levels of prosociality. For instance, may incentives such as tax breaks and blood donor rewards encourage prosocial behavior, if the social norms are such that it is accepted that people get something in return for their prosocial act?

\paragraph{Incorporating social norms in a model of prosocial behavior}

Social norms have been studied widely by various disciplines in the behavioral and social sciences, and many definitions for social norms have been proposed \citep{wallen_social_2017}. The oldest definition was brought forward by \cite{sherif_psychology_1936} who considered “customs, traditions, standards, rules, values, fashions, and all other criteria of conduct which are standardized as a consequence of the contact of individuals” as social norms (p. 3). Here we adopt a slightly less broad definition of social norms from \cite{cialdini_social_1998}: “Social norms are the rules and standards understood by members of a group, that guide and/or constrain social behaviors without the force of laws” (p.152).

A given behavior will naturally be influenced by a myriad of social norms. These social norms may not only be applied to the same behavior, but they may even be conflicting with each other \citep{cialdini_social_1998}. That is, one norm may be associated with a reputational cost while the other results in a reputational benefit. For example, when a person is in need for help but does not request it, the \textit{norm of societal responsibility} may be in conflict with the \textit{norm of privacy}. Also in the domain of prosocial behavior, there may be conflicting social norms: For instance, the \textit{norm of societal responsibility} \citep{cialdini_social_1998} and \textit{norms of fairness} \citep{fehr_theory_1999} may both lead to reputational benefits when performing a prosocial behavior, whereas the norm not to be (perceived as) a “do-gooder” or \textit{Gutmensch} \cite[see do-gooder derogation, which is the putting down of morally motivated others; ][]{minson_-gooder_2012, tasimi_-gooder_2015} may have the opposite effect and lead to reputational costs. Reputational motivation is then the result of the individual’s trade-off between the costs and benefits to his reputation given various social norms.

Thus, our assumption regarding the reputational component in our model of prosociality is as follows: Reputational motivation is determined by the \textit{sum} of reputational costs and benefits given the social norms that are associated with a specific behavior.
	
Interestingly, previous work has similarly employed abstractions in operationalizing reputational motivation. For instance, \cite{ariely_doing_2009} have defined reputational motivation as the motivation to “signal traits defined as "good" based on the community's norms and values” (p. 544) and subsequently opted for two examples of behavior that lie on relatively extreme ends of the spectrum of reputational outcomes, which allowed for an unambiguous deduction of whether a reputational cost or benefit is associated with the behavior: One behavior was to donate to the American Red Cross (which is associated with a clear reputational benefit) and the other was to donate to the National Rifle Association (which is associated with a reputational cost where subjects were students from a liberal U.S. university). In contrast to \cite{ariely_doing_2009}, we do not make such assumptions about reputational outcomes; Instead, we aggregate individual responses about the acceptability of certain incentives for a given prosocial behavior and thereby elicit the social norms that govern reputational outcomes empirically. 


\paragraph{Testing our model of prosociality}

Our model of prosocial behavior is based on the model of prosociality by \cite{benabou_incentives_2006} and is tested on an archetypal example of prosociality: blood donation. The case of blood donation is interesting, as it is a real-world example of prosocial behavior and it has a long history of debates regarding whether donors should be provided with (financial) incentives. As a result, different countries have adopted various policies regarding incentives for donors \citep{chell_systematic_2018, healy_embedded_2000}. In addition, there exists significant variation in the social norms associated with receiving incentives in return for a donation \citep{costa-font_not_2013}. In order to test for the contribution of the different motivational components that shape the decision to behave prosocially (namely intrinsic, extrinsic and reputational motivation), we assume that agents are nested within societal contexts and have the individual-level properties of (a) intrinsic motivation to behave prosocially, (b) extrinsic motivation (which arises if extrinsic rewards are associated with the behavior) and (c) reputational motivation (based on the reputational value ascribed to the behavior). An overview of relevant concepts and their relationships is provided in Fig. \ref{fig:overview}. Although intrinsic, extrinsic and reputational motivation are individual-level properties, extrinsic and reputational motivation are dependent on the societal context: Extrinsic motivation only impacts the decision to behave prosocially \textit{if} extrinsic rewards are provided. Similarly, differences in reputational motivation only arise \textit{if} there is variation in social norms. Therefore, we test the model by taking a cross-country comparative approach, which allows us to make use of variation in the provisioning of incentives for blood donation, as well as cross-societal differences in social norms. Additionally, the model takes into account individual-level cost of donation (for instance in terms of distance to a donation facility) as well as socio-demographic characteristics known to influence prosocial behavior, such as age, education and gender. Our hypotheses and analysis plan have been preregistered on the Open Science Framework (\url{https://osf.io/bf2kt/}).

\end{figure}



This work aims to contribute several novel insights: Firstly, we modify the conceptualization of reputational motivation, and extend it by taking into account social norms. Instead of making an assumption about the reputational outcome of certain behaviors, we elicit social norms empirically and use this as a proxy for reputational motivation related to extrinsic rewards. This is possible because we test the model in a cross-societal context, where we are able to exploit variation in social norms. Secondly, we apply this adapted theory of prosocial behavior to the “ultimately altruistic” act of blood donation, which provides a real-world test of the theoretical description of prosocial behavior and adds to a better understanding of the external validity of the model.

The remainder of this paper is structured in the following way: Firstly, we formally specify our model, building on the model developed by \cite{benabou_incentives_2006}. Within simulations we illustrate predictions of the model given different parameter settings. Then, we describe our methodology, including our dataset and operationalization of the variables in the model. Next, we present the results of the analyses examining the effect of incentives and social norms on prosocial behavior. Lastly, we conclude and offer further directions for future research.

\section{The Model}

We base our model on the model of prosocial behavior by \cite{benabou_incentives_2006}, and focus on binary prosocial activities that can either be performed or not (e.g., voting, donating blood; the model can generally also be applied to continuous contexts, e.g. charity donations, see \cite{benabou_incentives_2006}). In the beginning of this model description we concentrate on the isolated agent; That is, we ignore the societal context in which agents are nested until later parts of this section. Moreover, we retrace the steps of \cite{benabou_incentives_2006} and thus introduce the reputational motivation component only after summarizing the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation as the so called \textit{direct benefit} associated with the behavior.

Suppose an agent A with intrinsic motivation $v_{a} \in [0,1]$ and extrinsic motivation $v_{v} \in [0,1]$ must decide whether he engages in prosocial behavior $B$, which may be associated with extrinsic reward $R \in \{0,1\}$\footnote{\textit{Incentives} are extrinsic rewards that motivate behavior, and thus the two terms are here used interchangeably. For convenience, we take extrinsic rewards to be a binary variable, but the model can easily be modified to include continuous reward values.} and cost $c$. The direct benefit associated with the behavior is then the following: 

\begin{equation} 
 \mbox{\textit{direct benefit}} = B * (v_{a} + v_{v} * R) - B * c
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[t!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{images/direct_benefit.png}
    \caption{Visualization of the effects of varying cost of the behavior (as depicted in the four columns) and the presence of incentives (as depicted in the two rows) for individuals varying in intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The first row illustrates that in the absence of extrinsic rewards, intrinsic motivation and cost govern whether a behavior is performed (yellow line; For example, if cost is 0.4 and incentive = 0, then those individuals whose intrinsic motivation is greater than 0.4 perform the prosocial behavior, irrespective of their extrinsic motivation). In the second row, where incentives are provided, the line dividing those taking the action versus not (green line) shifts counterclockwise: More people engage in the prosocial behavior, because sufficiently extrinsically motivated individuals also engage in the behavior (For example, if cost is 0.6 and incentive = 1, those individuals whose intrinsic motivation is greater than 0.6 perform the prosocial behavior, as in the first row, and \textit{additionally} those individuals whose sum of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation is greater than 0.6 perform the prosocial behavior.).}
    \label{fig:model_IM_EM}
\end{figure}

In the absence of extrinsic rewards (i.e., $R = 0$), only intrinsic motivation $v_{a}$ and personal cost $c$ determine whether the prosocial action is performed. Personal cost here refers to the individual-level cost associated with the activity, for instance in terms of time, money, and resources. Although costliness of the behavior varies across individuals, it is also conceivable that some activities are highly costly for many people (such as donating a kidney) and are thus performed only by very few who have exceptionally high intrinsic motivation and relatively low cost. On the other hand, some behaviors may be associated with relatively low costs for most people (such as helping someone who tripped and fell) and are therefore performed by most people who have sufficiently high intrinsic motivation. Assuming that the prosocial behavior is performed if \textit{direct benefit} is greater for $B = 1$ than for $B = 0$, the effect of cost\footnote{For illustrative purposes, cost is here assumed to be the same for all individuals. This will however not be a constraint in our model, where cost will instead be able to vary across people.} is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:model_IM_EM}: In the first row we can see the effect of varying the cost of the prosocial activity in the absence of incentives. In the upper leftmost facet, most people engage in the behavior (red), because relatively low levels of intrinsic motivation suffice to engage in the relatively uncostly behavior. On the upper rightmost facet is the other extreme, where only the most highly intrinsically motivated members of society perform the prosocial action given the high associated costs.


When incentives are offered, the decision to perform the prosocial behavior is governed both by extrinsic and intrinsic motivation (as well as costs). This results in a higher total number of individuals that join in performing the behavior, because they are motivated by the extrinsic reward. The bottom row in Fig. \ref{fig:model_IM_EM} shows this effect: the dividing line between those who engage in the prosocial behavior and those who do not virtually tips over toward the left side, as individuals with insufficient intrinsic motivation but some extrinsic motivation now choose to perform the behavior as well. 

\paragraph{Reputational motivation}

\cite{benabou_incentives_2006} furthermore incorporate \textit{reputational motivation} in the model (i.e., the third motivational component besides intrinsic and extrinsic motivation), which is dependent on $VIS$, the visibility of the action (i.e., to what extent the behavior is performed in private vs. public), as well as $pref_{v_{a}}$ and $pref_{v_{v}}$, the individual’s preference to appear intrinsically motivated and not extrinsically motivated, respectively. Most importantly, reputational motivation is dependent on the \textit{expected value} of an individual’s intrinsic and extrinsic motivation given their behavior and the extrinsic reward associated with the behavior. In Benabou and Tirole’s (2006) model the expected value of extrinsic motivation $E(v_{v})$ is a \textit{cost} whereas the value of intrinsic motivation $E(v_{a})$ is a \textit{gain}. Reputational motivation à la \cite{benabou_incentives_2006} is thus defined as follows:

\begin{equation} 
 \mbox{\textit{reputational benefit}} =  VIS[pref_{v_{a}} * E(v_{a} | R, B) - pref_{v_{v}} * E(v_{v} | R, B)]
\end{equation}


As the authors point out, the first component of \textit{reputational benefit} (namely $VIS * pref_{v_{a}} * E(v_{a} | R, B)$; of which the driving factor is the expected value of intrinsic motivation $E(v_{a} | R, B))$ has the same effect when R = 1 and R = 0: Individuals who engage in the prosocial activity always have a higher expected intrinsic motivation than individuals who do not behave prosocially \citep{benabou_incentives_2006}. This holds irrespective of whether an extrinsic reward is offered. That is,

\begin{equation} 
 E(v_{a} | R = 0, B = 1) \mathbin{\color{red}>} E(v_{a} | R = 0, B = 0)
\end{equation}
\centerline{and}
\begin{equation} 
 E(v_{a} | R = 1, B = 1) \mathbin{\color{red}>} E(v_{a} | R = 1, B = 0)
\end{equation}


The same does not hold for the cost associated with higher expected extrinsic motivation: Here it is in fact the case that in the presence of incentives, the expected value for extrinsic motivation is higher for individuals engaging in the prosocial activity than not, and this is not the case when there are no incentives provided. That is,

\begin{equation} 
 E(v_{v} | R = 0, B = 1) \mathbin{\color{red}=} E(v_{v} | R = 0, B = 0)
\end{equation}
\centerline{and}
\begin{equation} 
 E(v_{v} | R = 1, B = 1) \mathbin{\color{red}>} E(v_{v} | R = 1, B = 0) 
\end{equation}


In other words, when no extrinsic rewards are provided, there is no information about the value of extrinsic motivation. But when extrinsic rewards are offered, the expected value of extrinsic motivation of prosocially behaving individuals is higher than that of non-prosocially behaving individuals. The effect that rewards have on expected extrinsic (but not intrinsic) motivation on the one hand, and the cost that is associated with being perceived as extrinsically motivated on the other, thus represents a key innovation in \citeauthor{benabou_incentives_2006}'s \citeyearpar{benabou_incentives_2006} model, because it elegantly accounts for what has been referred to as "motivational crowding-out": A negative effect of incentives can arise endogenously, as the cost of being perceived as extrinsically motivated offsets the benefits of extrinsic motivation itself.

\paragraph{Modification: Incorporating social norms}



A critical component of \textit{reputational benefit} as conceptualized by \cite{benabou_incentives_2006} is a hard-coded \textit{cost} of expected extrinsic motivation, as well as a fixed \textit{benefit} of expected intrinsic motivation. This can be highlighted by making explicit the constant terms applying to the effect of expected extrinsic and intrinsic motivation from equation (2):

\begin{equation} 
 \mbox{\textit{reput. benefit}} =  VIS[\mathbin{\color{red}(1)} * pref_{v_{a}} * E(v_{a} | R, B) + \mathbin{\color{red}(-1)} * pref_{v_{v}} * E(v_{v} | R, B)]
\end{equation}



This aspect of the model relies on the assumption that humans are generally motivated to appear intrinsically but not extrinsically motivated (i.e., unless the individual’s strength of preference to appear intrinsically motivated $pref_{v_{a}}$ and not extrinsically motivated $pref_{v_{v}}$ is zero, or the visibility $VIS$ of the action is zero, expected intrinsic motivation always represents a reputational \textit{benefit} and expected extrinsic motivation always represents a reputational \textit{cost} to an agent). We put this assumption into question and propose a key modification: The introduction of a parameter capturing the social norms that govern the reputational consequences of appearing intrinsically or extrinsically motivated.

We call this social norm variable $S$, and define it as the \textit{sum of reputational costs and benefits as dictated by the prevalent social norms} that are associated with a given behavior. This applies to both expected intrinsic motivation (i.e., $S_{v_{a}}$) and to expected extrinsic motivation (i.e., $S_{v_{v}}$). From this follows our definition of reputational benefit:

\begin{equation} 
 \mbox{\textit{reput. benefit}} =  VIS[\mathbin{\color{red}\textbf{$S_{v_{a}}$}} * pref_{v_{a}} * E(v_{a} | R, B) + \mathbin{\color{red}\textbf{$S_{v_{v}}$}} * pref_{v_{v}} * E(v_{v} | R, B)],
\end{equation}

\hspace{0.2 cm} where $S_{v_{a}} \in [-1,1]$ and $S_{v_{v}} \in [-1,1]$

%$$\mbox{\textit{reputational benefit}} = B * R * S \mbox{ , where  } S \in [-1,1]$$



%We thereby assume that the overall reputational value (i.e., cost \textit{or} benefit) is determined by the specific set of social norms that are prevalent in an individual’s environment. Depending on the environment, the net effect of social norms regarding incentives can be \textit{positive} or \textit{negative}.

\paragraph{The full model}

We again follow \cite{benabou_incentives_2006} in proposing an additive effect of the direct (equation (1)) and reputational (equation (8)) benefits of the behavior. That is, an agent A solves the following equation when deciding whether to engage in the prosocial behavior: 

\begin{equation} 
 Max		\{ \mbox{\textit{direct benefit + reputational benefit}} \}, B \in \{0,1\}
\end{equation}



%Hereby, intrinsic motivation and cost play a role in determining behavior irrespective of rewards; extrinsic motivation and reputational concerns regarding being perceived as extrinsically motivated only have an effect on prosocial behavior if incentives are provided. 

%In order to derive the predictions of the model for behavior, let us consider which benefits apply to which behavioral action: \textit{direct benefit} applies only to actions taken. That is, if B = 0, \textit{direct benefit} is zero. If B = 1, \textit{direct benefit} is equal to equation (1). As a consequence, when only taking into account \textit{direct benefit} and not \textit{reputational benefit}, prosocial behavior is performed if \textit{direct benefit} $> 0$.

%The same is not true for reputational benefit, as the expected values of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation are defined irrespective of B. In the 2x2 matrix below the total benefits (direct benefit + reputational benefit) associated with choosing not to perform the behavior (B = 0, first column) or performing the behavior (B = 1, second column) are presented; agent A must weigh his benefits given incentives being absent (R = 0, first row) or present (R = 1, second row):

%\begin{table}
%\small
%\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
%& B = 0 & B = 1 \\
%\hline
%R = 0 & $E(v_{a} |$ R=0, B=0) - $E(v_{v} |$ R=0, B=0) & $v_{a} - c +
%E(v_{a} |$ R=0, B=1) - $E(v_{v} |$ R=0, B=1)\\
%\hline
%R = 1 & $E(v_{a} |$ R=1, B=0) - $E(v_{v} |$ R=1, B=0) & $v_{a} + v_{v} - c +
%E(v_{a} |$ R=1, B=1) - $E(v_{v} |$ R=1, B=1) \\
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}

%Although the precise numerical values of expected intrinsic and extrinsic motivation depend on the nature of the prosocial activity (such as the cost $c$ of the behavior), we do have some insights about the expected values. Firstly, $E(v_{a})$ is always higher when $B = 1$ than when $B = 0$ (see (3) and (4)). When A weights his benefits for B = 0 versus B = 1, $E(v_{a})$ will thus always draw him to perform the prosocial behavior: $B = 1$. As \cite{benabou_incentives_2006} have mentioned, $E(v_{a})$ is thus not very informative, and the major contribution of the reputational motivation component does not come from a gain in $E(v_{a})$ but instead from a cost of $E(v_{v})$: From (5) we see that in the case of $R = 0$, $E(v_{v})$ is equivalent for both cases where the action is performed or not. When A weighs the benefits associated with choosing B in the absence of incentives ($R = 0$), $E(v_{v})$ will therefore cancel out on both sides. However, the same does not hold for the case when $R = 1$. In this case, $E(v_{v})$ is larger for $B = 1$ than for $B = 0$. This means that the agent faces an additional cost when performing the behavior in the presence of extrinsic rewards, and this may tip him over to not engaging in the action. This cost of higher expected extrinsic motivation $E(v_{v})$ thus plays a central role in implementing the negative effect of incentives on prosocial behavior.

%From these considerations we can approximate that under Benabou and Tirole’s (2006) model\footnote{As argued above, we take the effect of expected intrinsic motivation to be negligible. It can be included in the model as the positive difference between $E(v_{a} | B = 1)$ and $E(v_{a} | B = 0)$. As its sign is necessarily positive (see (3) and(4)), including this term would additionally encourage prosocial behavior. We also hold $VIS$ and $pref_{v_{v}}$ constant at 1, but these can easily be incorporated by adding them to the expected extrinsic motivation term: $E(v_{v} | B = 1) * VIS * pref_{v_{v}}$.}, prosocial behavior B is performed if the following holds:

%\begin{equation} 
% v_{a} - c + R * (v_{v}  -  E(v_{v} | B = 1, R = 1) )  \mathbin{\color{red}> 0}
%\end{equation}


%Thus, an agent A weighs his intrinsic motivation $v_{a}$, the cost of donation $c$, and, in case incentives R are provided, his extrinsic motivation $v_{v}$ and cost of expected extrinsic motivation $E(v_{v})$.



%Incorporating our modification into the full model, we thus predict that prosocial behavior B is performed if the following holds:

%$$v_{a} - c + R * (v_{v}  + S) \mathbin{\color{red}> 0}$$


\begin{figure}[b!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/total_benefit_SOC.png}
    \caption{In the presence of extrinsic rewards, the value of the social norms variable $S_{v_{v}}$ (where varying values are depicted across the rows) determines the shift on the x-axis of the diagonal line dividing those behaving prosocially versus not (green line; see description in main text).}
    \label{fig:model_SOC}
\end{figure}

In order to illustrate the effect of our model modification, let us consider the effect of varying levels of social norms on prosocial behavior. In particular, we demonstrate the effect of varying levels of $S_{v_{v}}$ on behavior in the presence of incentives, as $S_{v_{v}}$ determines how costly (if at all) it is to be perceived as extrinsically motivated; As we have seen previously, this effect plays the central role in explaining the partial or net crowding-out of prosocial behavior by incentives (see equations (3) - (6) and the related explanation).

Figure \ref{fig:model_SOC} depicts the effect of the social norms variable $S_{v_{v}}$ on prosocial behavior when incentives are offered\footnote{Note that for this simulation we employed equation 9, but ignored the effect of expected intrinsic motivation. Including this term would shift the green line to the left on the x-axis, as expected intrinsic motivation is always a benefit to those performing the behavior (see equation 4). We also kept $VIS$ and $pref_{v_{v}}$ constant at 1.}. The first row shows that a \textit{negative} value of $S_{v_{v}}$ shifts the diagonal line dividing those taking the action versus not (green line) toward the right on the x-axis. This has as a result that the extrinsic reward motivates some highly extrinsically motivated and moderately intrinsically motivated individuals to perform the behavior (i.e., those with lower intrinsic motivation than the yellow threshold line yet still above the green threshold line), but it also leads some individuals (who are highly intrinsically motivated and not highly extrinsically motivated) to stop performing the behavior. This is due to them carrying a reputational cost that comes about by social norms that characterize it as “bad” that the given prosocial behavior is performed while receiving an extrinsic reward. The first row in Fig. \ref{fig:model_SOC} thus describes the pattern which is predicted by \citeauthor{benabou_incentives_2006}'s \citeyearpar{benabou_incentives_2006} model that includes a fixed \textit{cost} of appearing extrinsically motivated.


The second row of Figure \ref{fig:model_SOC} illustrates the scenario where $S_{v_{v}}$ is zero. In this case, only extrinsic and intrinsic motivation plays a role (as well as cost), as is the case in the bottom row of Fig. \ref{fig:model_IM_EM}. Lastly, the third row of Fig. \ref{fig:model_SOC} illustrates the effect of a \textit{positive} value of $S_{v_{v}}$ on prosocial behavior, in which case the diagonal threshold line dividing those behaving prosocially versus not (green line) is shifted to the left on the x-axis. In this case, the combined positive effect of intrinsic, extrinsic and reputational motivation leads to high levels of prosocial behavior.



To sum up the model specification, we theorize an additive effect of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, cost, as well as reputational motivation governed by social norms. In the following empirical investigation we focus on a subset of the theoretical constructs that are part of our model of prosocial behavior: Intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, cost, incentives and social norms regarding incentives (i.e., $v_{a}$, $v_{v}$, $c$, $R$ and $S_{v_{v}}$).

\section{Materials and Methods}

\paragraph{Participants and procedure}

In order to test the model specified above we employ comparative data from the 2014 wave of the Eurobarometer (European Commission, 2014), combined with a survey about incentive policies among experts in the included European countries. The Eurobarometer (EB) is a repeated cross-sectional survey conducted on representative samples from the European Union (EU) member states. In 2014, the survey was performed in a total of 28 countries. A multi-stage random (probability) sampling design was employed and approximately 1000 face-to-face interviews were completed in each of the countries\footnote{Exceptions are Luxembourg, Cyprus and Malta with 500 interviews each, as well as the United Kingdom with separate samples for Great Britain (1000) and Northern Ireland (300) and Germany with separate samples for former East (500) and West (1000) Germany.}. Respondents were residents of the respective country, had sufficient command of the national language(s), and were 15 years or older. Study protocols were approved by the European Commission and all participants provided informed consent. The expert survey was conducted among specialists from blood collecting institutions who were contacted by email and provided responses either in writing or via a telephone interview\footnote{Incentive data for the Czech Republic, France, and the Netherlands were taken from a recent Vox Sanguinis expert survey on incentives across the globe \citep{zeller_vox_2020}.}.

\paragraph{Operationalization and Variables}

The 2014 round of the Eurobarometer included items on blood donation behavior, motivation to donate, and attitudes regarding incentives for blood donation. An overview of the dependent and independent variables, including the wording of survey items and measurement scales, are presented in supplementary Table \ref{tab:vars}. In the following we describe the operationalization of variables in more detail.

\textbf{Blood donation} The dependent variable in our analyses is blood donation during one's lifetime (yes/no). Participants in the Eurobarometer were asked whether they have ever donated substances of human origin, among them whole blood. 

\textbf{Intrinsic motivation} Intrinsic motivation is operationalized as the mentioning (yes/no) of an intrinsic motivational factor as a reason why respondents have donated or are willing to donate blood. Intrinsic motivation takes on the value 1 if one of three intrinsic motivational factors are mentioned: (a) to help other people in need, (b) to alleviate shortages of these substances, or (c) to support medical research. 

\textbf{Extrinsic motivation} Extrinsic motivation is operationalized as a set of variables: (a) mentioning (yes/no) of an extrinsic factor to be a reason for donating or being willing to donate blood (namely “to receive something in return for you or your relatives”), (b) the subjective difficulty in paying bills (three levels: almost never/never; from time to time; most of the time), and (c) an indication of lack of financial liquidity as suggested by current employment status (employed/not employed)\footnote{Note that the lack of current employment can be seen as a source of motivation for financial reward, but the \textit{presence of current employment} can also be seen as a \textit{cost} to donate, because working individuals are more affected by time constraints. This is considered when interpreting the effect of this variable.}. Although lack of current employment and subjective difficulty in paying bills may be related, we include both, because these indicators target partly overlapping but possibly distinct parts of the population that profit from earning extra money on the side: Those who are employed but do not earn enough (and therefore have trouble paying bills) and those who are not employed (such as students and retirees). By taking into account the current financial situation of the respondent, we acknowledge that the utility of monetary rewards is reference-dependent in that it hinges on the current assets of the individual \citep{tversky_loss_1991}. That is, we assume that individuals with lower income experience a higher increase in subjective utility from receiving a set amount of money compared to individuals with higher income\footnote{This is also in line with evidence that financial incentives are viewed more positively by younger donors who typically have fewer financial assets than older donors \citep{glynn_attitudes_2003}.}.

\textbf{Personal cost} Individuals face varying costs and constraints to donating blood. We include two possible factors that independently influence the costliness of donation: (a) time constraints due to child care \cite[i.e., parents of small children may perceive time constraints to donate,][operationalized as number of children in household]{piersma_blood_2019}, and (b) travel costs due to rural living (i.e., rural areas have a smaller density of blood collection organizations and therefore residents from these areas face greater costs both financially and in terms of travel time; three levels: large town; small/middle-sized town; rural area).

\textbf{Social norms regarding incentives} Social norms by definition apply to the (societal) group level, and we thus construct the social norm variable by aggregating responses of individual participants regarding the social acceptability of receiving incentives for blood donation for the 28 European countries. We calculate the social norm variable both for \textit{financial} incentives and \textit{time} incentives. The aggregated variables range from 0 (i.e., 0\% or respondents find financial/time incentives acceptable) to 1 (i.e., 100\% or respondents find financial/time incentives acceptable).

\textbf{Socio-demographic controls} Finally, we control for important confounding factors. Firstly, we take into account the age of respondents, as our dependent variable \textit{blood donation during lifetime} is dependent on years lived (i.e., older individuals have had more time in their life to have ever donated). Moreover, we include gender (male/female), education (in years, categorized in 4 levels), and partner status (cohabitating/not cohabitating) as socio-demographic control variables, as these variables were shown to be related to propensity to donate in previous studies (although there are some inconsistent findings between studies, for example related to gender; see \cite{piersma_individual_2017} for a recent review on donor demographics).


\textbf{Incentives} Incentives are rewards that are provided to donors with the goal of motivating donation.  For blood donation, large differences in the provision of incentives exist across countries. We constructed a database of incentives offered to donors in different European countries by conducting a survey among experts (either in interview or written form). Experts were largely employees from national blood collection agencies and were consulted about the type and value of incentives provided in their country. We explicitly asked experts not to report small-value incentives (as it is quite common that donors are given small rewards such as t-shirts, mugs or towels), as we are only interested in high-value (non-symbolic) incentives. Based on expert responses we constructed two country-level incentive variables, one for financial incentives (i.e., cash or other incentives with financial value, for example tax deduction; the incentive should be high-value, i.e., at least 10 Euro) and the other for time incentives (i.e., time off work). Financial incentives were categorized into: (a) offered by \textit{no} blood operators, (b) \textit{some} blood operators offer financial incentives but others do not, and (c) all blood operators offer financial incentives. Time incentives also had three levels: (a) offered by \textit{no} blood operators, (b) offered \textit{dependent on the employer} (i.e., in some countries only some employers offer donors to donate during work hours, often this was the case for government employees), and (c) offered \textit{independent of the employer}. Incentives enter the model in interaction terms with both extrinsic motivation and social norms. %The items from the expert survey as well as an overview of the incentive database is provided in the appendix.


\paragraph{Statistical analysis}

\textbf{Exclusion criteria} Respondents who are younger than 18 years are excluded, because their age would not allow them to donate blood in most EU countries. Although individuals above the age of 65 are usually not eligible anymore to donate blood, we include these subjects in our sample, because our dependent variable is blood donation \textit{during the lifetime}. 

\textbf{Multilevel modeling} We employ logistic multilevel mixed effects models for all main analyses, where individuals are nested in countries. This method allows us to include individual-level variables (e.g., intrinsic motivation) and country-level variables (e.g., social norms regarding incentives) as fixed effects, as well as allowing the intercept to vary by country. The estimation technique is maximum likelihood; Missing values are handled by means of listwise deletion. 

In order to find the best fitting model while avoiding overfitting, we take a procedural approach of implementing nested models. That is, we add the independent variables to the baseline model (i.e., the intercept-only model which only includes the random intercept) in a stepwise manner and compare the resulting model fit with AIC. To this end we first estimate the intercept-only model (the “empty model” without predictors), then add the demographic control variables, and finally incorporate our predictors of interest. We run separate models for financial and non-financial (time) incentives; the predictors of interest for the former models are intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, cost, social norms regarding financial incentives, and financial incentives, whereas the key predictors of the latter models are intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation\footnote{Extrinsic motivation for time incentives is re-operationalized such that it captures motivation for the extrinsic reward of \textit{time}. As for financial incentives, the mentioning of an extrinsic motivational factor (i.e., getting something in return) is one measure of extrinsic motivation. The other measure for extrinsic motivation for time is employment, because individuals who are employed should be motivated more by getting time off work than those unemployed.}, cost, social norms regarding time incentives, and time incentives. 

Moreover, we test for the significance of the random component of the intercept-only model by performing log-likelihood-ratio tests of models with and without random intercepts for country.

\textbf{Robustness checks} As the \textit{intrinsic motivation} item (i.e., whether respondents are motivated by intrinsic factors) and one of the \textit{extrinsic motivation} items (i.e., whether respondents are motivated by extrinsic factors) was only asked to those who have either donated in the past, or who are willing to donate in the future, by design respondents who did not respond to these items are non-donors. Therefore we have a bias in these variables, and it is necessary to check for the robustness of effects for these two indicators. We thus additionally run all the analyses above excluding those respondents who have not answered these two items. 

We preregistered our hypotheses, variable operationalization and analyses on the Open Science Framework (\url{https://osf.io/bf2kt/})\footnote{Only analyses pertaining to blood donation are presented in this manuscript, whereas the preregistration additionally contains analyses with plasma donation as the dependent variable. Moreover, we deviate from the preregistration in two respects: Firstly, instead of creating a “conditional” social norm and extrinsic motivation variable (i.e., setting these variables to 0 if no incentive is offered), we employ interactions between incentives and social norms and between incentives and extrinsic motivation. Secondly, we realized that we cannot run a robustness check excluding those countries not offering incentives, because this resulted in a too small sample size at the country-level, which again prevented us from testing country-level variables (social norms and incentives) and interactions involving country-level incentives on this smaller sample.}. Moreover, our analyses are fully reproducible from code and data available on Github (\url{https://github.com/weltenbummler123/incentives}).


\section{Results}

We present the results in three steps: first, we present descriptives and the analysis of random effects and demographics. Then we report the findings related to intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to donate blood, the effect of social norms, and how this interacts with (financial) incentives; and finally we sketch the results from analyses pertaining to non-financial incentives.

Overall, 38.4\% (n = 10195\footnote{The supplementary material contains information on exclusion of respondents.}) of all included respondents have ever donated blood. This varied substantially across countries (see Fig. \ref{fig:map_BD}): Donation rates range from 22.8\% of respondents from Portugal having ever donated blood to 52.9\% of respondents from France having donated blood. Table \ref{table:descriptives} displays descriptives of demographic variables and predictors of interest. Figure \ref{fig:map_descr} further displays the geographic distribution of the predictors of interest in our models, which also showed substantial variation across countries (intrinsic motivation: ${X}^2(27) = 1501.5, p < 0.001$; extrinsic motivation: ${X}^2(27)= 408.58, p < 0.001$; social norms regarding financial incentives: ${X}^2(27) = 1970.7, p < 0.001$). Notably, levels of intrinsic motivation to donate (see \ref{fig:map_descr}A) were high across all countries (country-level means ranging from 41.3\% in Bulgaria to 88.0\% in Sweden), albeit higher in Western and Northern European countries compared to Eastern European countries. In contrast, mentioning the extrinsic factor “getting something in return” as motivation to donate was relatively rare (see \ref{fig:map_descr}B; country-level means range from 1.3\% in Italy to 12.7\% in Finland). The social norm variable regarding the acceptability of financial incentives for donating blood (see \ref{fig:map_descr}C; values range from 2.2\% in Cyprus to 39.3\% in Bulgaria) also varied widely across the European Union with virtually no acceptance of financial incentives in countries such as Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom, but higher levels of approval in Eastern and Central European countries such as Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Latvia. Lastly, the expert survey revealed that only few European countries are offering high-value financial incentives for whole blood: In Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Portugal all blood operators offer high-value incentives to donors. In Germany, some blood operators offer incentives (e.g., hospital-based blood operators), whereas others (e.g., the Red Cross) do not.
\\

A log-likelihood test comparing the intercept-only model with the intercept-only model that allows the intercept to vary per country provided strong evidence that including the random intercept component is justified (${\chi}^2(1)=501.79, p < 0.001$). Adding demographics to the model improved the model fit further ($AIC_{demo} = 33097.4 < AIC_{intercept-only} = 34848.6$). As expected given that our dependent variable is blood donation \textit{during the lifetime}, older respondents were more likely to have donated ($b = 0.166, p < 0.001$). The other socio-demographic control variables were also significantly related to blood donation in the following manner: male ($b = -0.471, p < 0.001$) and more educated respondents (full-time education until 16-19 years: $b = 0.395, p < 0.01$; full-time education until 20 years or more: $b = 0.697, p < 0.001$), and those living with a partner ($b = 0.129, p < 0.001$) were more likely to have donated blood during their lifetime.



\paragraph{Intrinsic motivation}

The full model\footnote{The model for financial incentives excludes respondents from Germany, as Germany was the only country where \textit{some} blood operators offer financial incentives. In all other countries financial incentives were offered either by all blood operators or by none. All results are quantitatively equivalent when Germany is included and regrouped either in the group of countries offering financial incentives or in the group not offering financial incentives. Note that for analyses pertaining to \textit{time} incentives Germany is included (as multiple countries fall into each of the time incentive categories), which results in differing sample sizes for these two analyses (i.e., for \textit{financial} incentives $n_{respondents} = 25068$, $n_{region} = 63$ and $n_{country} = 27$, whereas for \textit{time} incentives $n_{respondents} = 26532$, $n_{region} = 68$ and $n_{country} = 28$).} (see supplementary Table \ref{tab:model_financial}) with demographics and our effects of interest (including interactions between incentives and extrinsic motivation and social norms), as well as intercepts that are able to vary per country, revealed a significant contribution of intrinsic motivation ($b = 1.346, p < 0.0001$). That is, individuals who reported being motivated by the desire to help those in need, alleviate shortages, or support medical research were more likely to have donated blood\footnote{As a robustness check, we implemented the same model on a subset of respondents, namely excluding those who were not given a chance to mention intrinsic motivational factors to donate (due to a lack of donation history and no reported willingness to donate in the future); for this sample we also found a significant positive effect of intrinsic motivation on blood donation ($b = 0.091, p < 0.05)$.}.

\paragraph{Social norms, incentives and extrinsic motivation}

Testing the full model revealed a positive main effect of social norms regarding financial incentives ($b = 0.125, p < 0.05$), but a negative main effect of financial incentives themselves ($b = -0.512, p < 0.01$). This indicates that respondents in countries where incentives are offered are less likely to have donated blood in the past, but that individuals residing in countries with positive norms regarding financial incentives are more likely to have donated. The effect of extrinsic motivation (in terms of getting something in return as a motivation to donate) was positive but only marginally significant ($b = 0.11, p = 0.08$)\footnote{Similarly to the robustness check done with with intrinsic motivation, we also ran the former model on the subset of respondents which excluded those who had not previously donated and were not willing to donate; for this sample we did not find a significant positive association between extrinsic motivation (i.e., receiving something in return) and blood donation. In addition, the two other extrinsic motivation indicators related to respondents’ utility of monetary rewards (i.e., lack of employment and difficulty paying bills) had no positive effect on blood donation, contrary to our expectations. Instead, lack of employment was significantly associated with lower levels of blood donation and difficulty in paying bills was unrelated to donation behavior.}.

\label{fig:interactions}
\end{figure}


Theoretically interesting are the interaction effects between incentives and extrinsic motivation on the one hand and incentives and social norms on the other. The former was marginally significant (for incentive = 1: $b = 0.283, p = 0.09$), such that respondents who indicated to be motivated by extrinsic motives tended to be more likely to have donated blood if they lived in a country where incentives are offered\footnote{The predictive margins derived by the model for an “average” European woman (i.e., mean-aged, living with a partner, with secondary education, employed, living in a small town, with mean-number of children, rarely having difficulty paying bills, and intrinsically motivated) for donating blood is 44.7\% if she is extrinsically motivated and lives in a country offering incentives and 35.3\% if she is not extrinsically motivated living in a country offering incentives (on the other hand, her predicted probability to donate is 50.3\% when she is extrinsically motivated residing in a country without incentives opposed to 47.6\% when she is not extrinsically motivated residing in a country without incentives). Moreover, applying the robustness check to the model by employing the sample excluding respondents who had not previously donated and were not willing to donate found no significant interaction effect of extrinsic motivation and incentives.}. The latter interaction effect between incentives and social norms was also in the expected direction, but not significant. 

Figure \ref{fig:interactions}A displays the association of social norms and incentives with blood donation: Social norms are positively associated with blood donation, irrespective of whether incentives were offered (blue line) or not (red line). Incentives on the other hand were negatively related to blood donation overall. That is, in countries where incentives are offered, an “average” European woman (i.e., mean-aged, living with a partner, with secondary education, employed, living in a small town, with mean-number of children, rarely having difficulty paying bills, intrinsically but not extrinsically motivated) has a predicted probability of donating blood of 32.7\% when financial incentives are deemed acceptable only by 11.3\% of the population (as is the case in Portugal), but her predicted probability to donate increases to 46.0\% if social norms are more positive, as in the Czech Republic where 32.4\% of the population approves of financial incentives.

In exploratory analyses we further investigated within-country regional associations of social norms with blood donation behavior. To this end we implemented the full model as specified above (including all individual-level variables such as intrinsic motivation, as well as incentive as a country-level variable), but entered social norms as a region-level variable (aggregation was across $n_{region} = 63$, opposed to $n_{country} = 27$). Results from these analyses were qualitatively equivalent (see supp. Fig. \ref{fig:scatter_region}A) and quantitatively similar to our main confirmatory analyses.

\paragraph{Non-financial incentives}

In addition to providing information regarding which countries offer high-value \textit{financial} incentives, the expert survey furthermore showed that several countries employ high-value \textit{non-financial} incentives for blood donation, in particular time off work (see supp. Fig. \ref{fig:time_maps}A: 14 out of 28 countries offer some kind of time incentive). Countries that offer time off work to blood donors (independent of employer policies) include Eastern European countries such as Bulgaria and Romania, but also Southern European countries such as Italy and Portugal. In other European countries, a subset of employers allow donors to take time off work for making the donation (for instance in Belgium, Croatia, Greece and Sweden). Country-level social norms regarding the acceptability of time incentives also varied substantially across countries (${X}^2(27) = 2436.6, p < 0.001$; values range from 11.8\% in Spain to 70.4\% in Sweden, see supp. Fig. \ref{fig:time_maps}B). Social norms regarding time incentives were more positive (mean = 0.43) than those regarding financial incentives (mean = 0.15; Mann–Whitney $U(n_{1} = n_{2} = 28) = 736, p < 0.001$).

The associations between blood donation behavior and socio-demographics as well as intrinsic motivation were the same for the models including time incentives as they were for financial incentives (see supp. Table \ref{tab:model_time}). However, in contrast to the results pertaining to financial incentives, there was no main effect of non-financial incentives. That is, living in a country providing non-financial incentives was overall neither positively nor negatively associated with blood donation. In addition, there was neither a main effect for extrinsic motivation (in terms of getting something in return as a motivation to donate) nor for social norms regarding non-financial incentives. Instead, the model results revealed a significant positive interaction between non-financial incentives and social norms ($b = 0.528, p = 0.001$)\footnote{ When splitting the sample according to respondents' employment status and running separate models on these subsets of respondents, we found the same results for both of these models as for the main model. The finding that the same associations are found for \textit{unemployed} individuals (who cannot currently profit from time off work) as for employed individuals is likely due to temporal discrepancy of the measures (see general discussion).}. This effect is depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:interactions}B: Individuals residing in countries offering time incentives had a 58.2\% predicted probability of donating if social norms were more positive (such as in Slovenia, where 63.4\% of the population approves of non-financial incentives), but only a 38.4\% predicted probability of donating if social norms were relatively more negative (e.g., in Italy where 37.6\% of the population approves of non-financial incentives). %On the other hand, respondents living in countries not offering time incentives had a predicted probability to donate of 38.7\% when social norms were rather negative, and a predicted probability of 30.2\% when social norms were more positive.

In addition, we found a positive trend in the interaction between non-financial incentives and extrinsic motivation ($b = 0.256, p = 0.09$). That is, individuals tended to have a higher probability of donating blood if they lived in a country with time incentives and were extrinsically motivated than those residing in countries providing time incentives but not being extrinsically motivated %(see supp. Fig. \ref{fig:bar_EM}B and \ref{fig:bar_EM}D).

As with financial incentives, we implemented further exploratory analyses for time incentives examining within-country regional social norms for time incentives. That is, we ran the full model, but entered social norms as a region-level variable (aggregation was across $n_{region} = 68$, opposed to $n_{country} = 28$). Results from these analyses were again qualitatively similar (see supp. Fig. \ref{fig:scatter_region}B). Quantitative results were somewhat different from our main confirmatory analyses, in that the interaction effect between social norms and incentives was only present for women and not for men.

\section{Discussion}

\paragraph{Summary}

In this paper we extended a model of prosociality that posits an additive effect of intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, reputational motivation, and costs. Our key theoretical contribution is the introduction of social norms. We argue that reputational costs or benefits are a product of social norms, that is how acceptable certain actions are viewed by members of a society. In our view this theoretical modification allows us to address different empirical puzzles, such as the inconsistent effect of incentives on prosocial behavior across contexts. We tested this model on a real-world prosocial behavior, namely blood donation, for which incentives offered as well as social norms regarding incentives vary by country. In line with previous studies, our preregistered analyses revealed that intrinsic motivation is a key individual-level factor motivating blood donation. In addition, we found a positive association between country-level social norms for financial incentives and blood donation: the more positive the social norm, the higher the probability of having donated blood. Interestingly, the effect of incentives depends on the type of incentive offered. Whereas financial incentives are negatively associated with blood donation, non-financial incentives were on their own unrelated to the likelihood of donating. Yet, we found that the effect of non-financial incentives depends on social norms; That is, in countries where non-financial incentives are offered, likelihood to donate was higher when social norms regarding these incentives were positive, than when social norms were more negative. 

\paragraph{Social norms flexibly explain effects of incentives on prosociality}

As in previous experimental and field studies \cite[see ][]{gneezy_when_2011, chell_systematic_2018}, we found that incentives have an inconsistent effect on prosocial behavior. Whereas time incentives alone had no effect on the likelihood of blood donation, financial incentives had a direct negative effect. Our empirical evidence thus highlights the fact that a \textit{flexible} mechanism must be at play in determining the effect of incentives on prosocial behavior. With a flexible mechanism we mean that the effect of incentives is altered depending on context.

Previous models have been responsive to this required flexibility by bringing forward explanations that focus on a \textit{change in perception} or \textit{meaning} of the prosocial act by the introduction of incentives \cite[e.g., ][]{heyman_effort_2004, gneezy_pay_2000, benabou_incentives_2006}. To capture such a change in perception the notion of \textit{reputational} motivation has proven useful \citep{benabou_incentives_2006, ariely_doing_2009}, as it had more explanatory power than prior explanations focusing solely on the deterioration of intrinsic motivation by extrinsic rewards. Building on this, we proposed to integrate social norms in an account of prosocial behavior involving incentives, as social norms capture precisely the \textit{specific} reputational effect of a given behavior for a given group of people.

Our empirical evidence from blood donation behavior across countries indicate that social norms indeed play an important role in determining the effect of incentives on prosocial behavior. That is, not only is there a difference between the effects of financial and non-financial incentives, but the social norm regarding the incentive predicts how much the probability to donate increases. For example, time incentives were viewed rather negatively in some countries offering them, and respondents from these countries had a lower likelihood to donate compared to respondents in countries without time incentives. On the other hand, in countries where social norms regarding time incentives were more positive, respondents were \textit{more} likely to donate than comparable respondents from countries not offering time incentives. Similarly for financial incentives, the likelihood to donate increased if social norms were more positive, even though financial incentives themselves had a negative effect on the likelihood of donating blood. As such, our findings not only highlight the relevance of Bénabou and Tirole’s (2006) theory in a large population, but they also emphasize the role that social norms play for the interplay of incentives and prosocial behavior.

Notably, social norms regarding both financial and time incentives varied widely across Europe\footnote{The observed variation in norms is particularly striking considering that our sample included only European countries, who are relatively similar in terms of history and ideology, and who even share political structures.}. That is, it was not the case that all countries had the same social norms regarding financial incentives (given a transaction in a “monetary market”), and again the same norms regarding non-financial incentives (given a “social market” situation), as would be expected from Heyman and Ariely’s (2004) account which draws a binary distinction between monetary and social markets\footnote{Although it should be noted that the non-monetary rewards in Heyman and Ariely’s (2004) studies were of equal monetary value as the financial rewards. In our case the monetary value of receiving time off work is in fact often equivalent or \textit{higher} than the value of the financial incentive typically offered to donors. Thus it is particularly notable that we found more positive social norms regarding these higher valued non-financial rewards than for financial rewards.}. However, we did find that social norms regarding non-financial incentives for prosocial behavior were significantly more positive than those regarding financial incentives\footnote{However, this was also not true for all countries: Austria, for example, had more positive social norms regarding financial incentives than for time incentives.}, which is in line with the intuition that indeed there exists a distinction between monetary and non-monetary contexts in many everyday situations, at least in Europe. 

One aspect of our results regarding social norms for \textit{financial} incentives was puzzling and not as hypothesized: there was also an increase in donation likelihood for more positive social norms when no financial incentives were offered. A possible explanation for this may be that more positive norms regarding financial incentives capture additional societal attitudes that impact donation behavior. For example, positive attitudes regarding financial incentives for blood donors may reflect valuation of the donor status generally, as an action worth rewarding. Perhaps it is the case that higher acceptability of the donation act as \textit{not} purely altruistic positively affects likelihood of donation irrespective of incentives offered. Another explanation may be that previous blood donors have experienced the costs of donation (e.g., in terms of time), and are therefore more likely to find it acceptable \textit{hypothetically} that donors receive financial incentives, even if in their country it is not the case that incentives are provided.

%It also remains an open question whether the effect of social norms found in the present study reflects a reputational \textit{cost}, as was formalized by \cite{benabou_incentives_2006} in a cost of being perceived as extrinsically motivated. We cannot answer this definitively, because the effects from the regression models cannot be translated directly to the formal model described in the previous section, because we do not know the extent of contribution of extrinsic and reputational motivation. For example, our finding that time incentives have a positive effect when social norms are positive is consistent with two explanations: (a) a reputational \textit{benefit} from social norms and a small effect of extrinsic motivation or (b) a large effect of extrinsic motivation and neutral or even small negative effect of social norms. We did not find a significant association between extrinsic motivation and prosocial behavior, but this may be due to our design not being able to effectively capture extrinsic motivation (see limitations). However, social norms in some countries were very positive, particularly for time incentives, where up to 70\% of the population approved time incentives for blood donation. This indicates that there are in fact societal contexts where appearing to be extrinsically motivated does not lead individuals’ reputations to suffer.

\paragraph{Implications}

The most direct implication that follows from our empirical findings is that incentives can be associated with increased levels of prosocial behavior, \textit{if} social norms regarding the incentive are sufficiently positive. As financial incentives are in no country accepted by the majority of the population (i.e., social norms regarding financial incentives are equal or below 40\% in all countries), we do not know whether donation likelihood could be higher in a country employing financial incentives than in a country that does not, \textit{if} social norms regarding financial incentives were to become more positive. For time incentives, it appears that individuals from countries offering incentives have a higher likelihood of donating than those in countries that do not offer incentives, if social norms reach a threshold of about 0.5 (i.e., 50\% of the population accepts time incentives, see the intersection of lines in Fig. \ref{fig:interactions}B). 

Thus, a promising intervention to encourage prosocial behavior could be to make views regarding the acceptability of incentives more positive. Although social norm change is an intricate process \citep{cialdini_social_1998}, it may be possible that policy makers can positively influence views for specific combinations of incentives and prosocial acts. For instance, blood operators may be able to propagate views deeming it appropriate that donors receive time off work for their kind act of helping strangers in need\footnote{We should however note that the proportions of people ever having donated is remarkably high in our sample, and that these proportions are presumably substantially higher than the proportions of \textit{regular} donors in any country. Therefore, it is possible that many of the donors in our sample are infrequent donors, which again may have different attitudes and characteristics from frequent donors. Thus the conclusions we can draw regarding these more regular donors are limited.}.

Curiously, Eastern and Central European countries had more positive social norms regarding incentives, and were also more likely to offer incentives to donors. This raises the question what broader historical and cultural evolutionary processes may be the origin of this pattern. One relevant explanation may be related to variation in (post-)materialist values across European countries. As Eastern European countries (but also parts of southern Europe) are yet in earlier stages of economic development and have more economic scarcity compared with Western European countries, they may be more concerned with materialist goals \citep{inglehart_globalization_2000, inglehart_economic_1994}, and may thus be more likely to offer incentives and have positive norms regarding the provision of incentives.

\paragraph{Limitations and future directions}

In this work we drew on insights from various disciplines in order to introduce a key theoretical modification to explain the effect of incentives on prosocial behavior: social norms. We empirically tested this interdisciplinary model of prosociality on a real-world prosocial behavior, namely blood donation, for which we created a novel dataset of incentives provided to blood donors across Europe. Different from what experimental studies can offer, our unique approach allowed us to investigate the effect of social norms “in the wild”; That is, we were able to examine \textit{empirically elicited} norms across countries which are typically very persistent and have a long cultural evolutionary history. Our findings have concrete implications for blood operators and offer clues for encouraging and influencing prosocial behavior more generally.

However, there are also limitations to our approach, which are described in the following. As a consequence of making use of Eurobarometer data, the existing measures did not always ideally capture our theoretical concepts\footnote{ Obtaining (representative) samples from a sufficiently large number of countries is a major challenge for comparative studies such as ours. In the case of blood donation, the 2014 wave of the Eurobarometer is to our knowledge the only dataset which contains data on blood donation behavior that is comparable across multiple countries (as well as including attitudes towards different types of rewards and motivational factors). While this dataset thus has the advantage of offering rich population data for dozens of countries, our inability to precisely design the survey items has led to potential shortcomings regarding the operationalization of our theoretical constructs.}. 
One issue concerns the Eurobarometer employing a selection criteria for questions regarding intrinsic and extrinsic motivation: only respondents who had either donated in the past or were willing to donate in the future subsequently received the question concerning motivational factors. 
As our chief interest concerned the relationship between incentives, social norms and blood donation (for which data was available for all respondents), this issue does not compromise our main results, which were computed based on the full sample (including donors and non-donors). However, the selection criteria does result in bias when examining the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. For this reason we performed robustness checks by running the main analyses on the subset of participants who received the question related to motivational factors; However, these robustness checks suffer from their own shortcomings, for instance decreased power due to starkly reduced sample sizes.
Moreover, it is problematic that the question regarding motivational factors included three intrinsic motivational factors as response options and only one extrinsic one, and that there may have been an order effect as the extrinsic motivational choice was always presented last. A measure of these motivational factors that targets more specifically individuals’ pleasure in helping others and their utility of (non-)monetary rewards may be better able to quantify the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Additionally, the Eurobarometer permitted only a very simplistic measure of social norms, namely the aggregation of acceptability ratings at the societal level. Particularly when there is lack of consensus in a society regarding the acceptability of an incentive, uncertainty about negative consequences to his reputation may lead the respondent to self-report disapproval of financial incentives, especially because this dishonesty is not costly to him \citep{diekmann_green_2003, rauhut_sociological_2010}. Moreover, validity of the social norm measure could be improved by a more sophisticated measurement approach, for instance by the strategy method \cite[see ][]{rauhut_sociological_2010}. 

%Further research could also investigate social norms at a more local level, as we may in fact be painting with an overly broad brush when aggregating social norms at the country-level \cite[see e.g.,][ on social norms in neighborhoods]{ellickson_order_1994}.

%\footnote{Particularly our crude measures related to individuals’ \textit{extrinsic} motivation in terms of financial hardship (i.e., trouble paying bills and lack of employment) were likely confounded by other factors and not associated with blood donation as hypothesized: Financial trouble was not associated with donation behavior, and unemployed individuals had in fact a \textit{lower} probability of donating than those employed. The latter finding is however in line with evidence from a study examining the effect of life events on blood donor lapse, which demonstrated that blood donors who lost their jobs were 50\% more likely to stop donating than those who kept their job \citep{piersma_blood_2019}.}

Additionally, some of our predictors may be less reliable due to suffering from a temporal discrepancy. That is, whereas our dependent variable is blood donation \textit{during the lifetime}, many moderators are \textit{current} indicators at the time of the survey, for instance occupation and financial situation. Thus the current situation may not correspond to the situation during which the respondent donated. As an example of why this may be problematic, take Germany: One major group of donors that makes use of monetary incentives in Germany are university students \citep{weidmann_blood_2013}, whose financial situation is relatively weak but who have good prospects of a high-paying position in the future.

Lastly, we cannot draw any causal conclusions with our observational methods. That is, our finding of lower donation rates in countries offering financial incentives does not necessarily mean that incentives do not encourage donation, and the association between country-level social norms and donation rates may be due to other factors. In order to validate our theoretical model further, an important task for future research will thus be an experimental test of the relationship between social norms, incentives, and prosocial behavior.

\paragraph{Information regarding exclusions}

For whole blood donation, 2.8\% of the participants refused to answer the dependent variable question on donation behavior and were excluded from the sample. Moreover, we excluded respondents younger than 18 years old, as these individuals are not eligible to donate in most European countries; this led to an additional 2.0\% of respondents being excluded. The analyses were run on the resulting sample of $n_{1} = 26,532$.
