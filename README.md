# Social norms explain Effects of Incentives on Prosocial Behavior

Welcome to our research project page!

## Overview

**Abstract:** Incentives have surprisingly inconsistent effects when it comes to encouraging people to behave prosocially. That is, the effects of incentives vary across incentive types, private versus public settings and across countries. Previous theoretical accounts have aimed at explaining these empirical phenomena by postulating an additive effect of intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, reputational motivation, and costs. We build on these theories, but call into question whether reputational motivation can be derived a priori, for instance by assuming an immutable cost to being perceived as extrinsically motivated. Instead, we argue that reputational concerns are governed by social norms, that is how acceptable certain actions are viewed by members of society. We go on to test our model comparatively on the real-world prosocial behavior of blood donation. We find that financial incentives have a direct negative effect on prosociality, and that social norms regarding financial incentives were rather negative, with the majority of the population in all countries considering them unacceptable. However, those respondents in countries with more positive social norms were more likely to have donated blood. On the other hand, social norms regarding non-financial incentives were substantially more positive compared to those regarding financial incentives. Crucially, the more positive the country-level social norms were, the more likely were individuals residing in these countries to have donated, when non-financial incentives were offered in this country. The results indicate that social norms regarding incentives play an important role in determining the effect of incentives on prosocial behavior.
