# Social Norms Explain the Inconsistent Effects of Incentives on Prosocial Behavior

## Overview

**Abstract:** Incentives have surprisingly inconsistent effects when it comes to encouraging people to behave prosocially. Classical economic theory struggles to account for these effects, as it predicts an increased supply of behavior that is incentivized. More recent theories therefore posit a reputational cost offsetting the benefits from receiving an incentive -- yet unexplained effects of incentives remain, for instance across incentive types and countries. We propose social norms can offer an explanation for these inconsistencies. This is because social norms determine the reputational costs or benefits resulting from a given behavior, and thus variation in the effect of incentives may reflect variation in norms. We implemented a formal model of prosocial behavior integrating social norms, which we empirically tested on the real-world prosocial behavior of blood donation. Blood donation is crucial for the functioning of medical systems, but also presents an ideal testing ground for our theory: Various incentive policies for blood donors exist across countries, enabling a comparative approach. Our preregistered analyses reveal that social norms can indeed account for the varying effects of financial and time incentives on individual-level blood donation behavior across 28 European countries. That is, incentives are associated with higher levels of prosociality when norms regarding the incentive are more positive. The results indicate social norms play an important role in explaining the relationship between incentives and prosocial behavior. More generally, our approach highlights the potential of integrating theory from across the economic and behavioral sciences to generate novel insights, with tangible consequences for policy making.
